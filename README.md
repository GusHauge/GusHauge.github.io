# Gus Hauge Portfolio Website | <a href="https://gushauge.github.io">GusHauge.github.io</a>

Welcome to the source code for my personal website! Built with React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Create React App, this site is a space for me to share my work, story, and growth as a developer.

## Why I Built It

For a long time, building a portfolio felt out of reach. After gaining real-world experience with JavaScript and React during my IBM internship, I realized I finally had the tools - and the confidence - to create something from scratch. I wanted a fun, interactive space that reflected me, built without relying on internal libraries or pre-made templates.

## What I Learned

This project pushed me beyond my comfort zone. I navigated new tools like gh-pages, styled everything responsively with TailwindCSS, and learned to trust both planning and experimentation in proper balance. Most of all, I proved to myself that I could design and ship a project on my own terms.
