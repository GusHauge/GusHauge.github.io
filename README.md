# Gus Hauge Portfolio Website | <a href="https://gushauge.github.io">GusHauge.github.io</a>

Welcome to the source code for my personal website! It was built using Create React App, React.js, and Tailwind CSS.

## Motivation
Portfolio websites have always been daunting to me. For a long time it was an idea tucked into the back of my mind that
I wanted to do but just couldn't. I picked up basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript during a Web Development class my Junior year but could only create very simple designs. Finally, during my internship at IBM, I picked up extensive JavaScript and 
React.js experience and realized that I had all the skills I needed. I wanted a place where I could share my story, skills, 
and projects. But just as much as this, I wanted to challenge myself to craft a website without the internal libraries I had 
been using at my internship.

## Process
Once I got started, the workflow for this project was fairly simple. I made changes from a dev branch, pushed it and merged 
to main, and then used npm run deploy to deploy the site using gh-pages. I made use of detailed commit messages to easily 
track my progress and tried to make frequent commits for ease of editing and backtracking if need be.

## Difficulties
Initially, I was unfamiliar with the gh-pages deployment setup which led to quite a lot of headache and even a 
complete restart after a frustrating late night early on in project development. I had done quite a bit of React development
at my IBM internship but had also relied heavily on internal libraries for pre-made components and page templates. With this
project I was working with a completely blank canvas. This was extremely intimidating, but once I dove into the project I
was able to appreciate the creative freedom this gave me. I was able to use so many visual elements that would not have been
possible with most corporate React libraries. In particular, I struggled with responsive styling since my work with IBM was
mainly catered to desktop users, not mobile. Thankfully, TailwindCSS has excellent features that make breakpoint-based
styling simple once you're over the learning curve. By the end of the project, I felt very confident in my ability to style
pages for different kinds of devices.

## Takeaways
There is so much that I learned from this project but I'll try to boil it down to a few points. First, the best way to solve
a problem is to take it on head-first and actively try out solutions. While this may seem self-evident, it becomes visualized
in a special way when working with web design. There were many times I would be scared to drastically change my page's
layout but whenever I broke it down to try something new it worked out so much better. Second, you need to have a gameplan
before you begin a new project. This seems directly opposed to the last point, but effective work requires a balance
between the two. There were times when I would start styling a page without any real image of the final design and it would
always end in disaster. Before you start trying different options, you need a holistic picture. Third and final, don't let
your current knowledge and skills limit your vision. There were so many times when I wanted to do something - such as a
fade in/fade out dropdown menu for small screen sizes - and I would have no idea where to start. It might take a lot of
online research and trial-and-error but I would learn so much through the process and be better equipped for future problems.
