# Gus Hauge Portfolio Website | <a href="https://gushauge.github.io">GusHauge.github.io</a>

Welcome to the source code for my personal website! It was built using Create React App, React.js, and Tailwind CSS.

## Motivation
Portfolio websites have always been daunting to me. For a long time it was an idea tucked into the back of my mind that
I wanted to do but just couldn't. I picked up basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript during a Web Development class but could only
do very simple designs. Finally, during my internship at IBM, I picked up extensive JavaScript and React.js experience and
realized that I had all the skills I needed. I wanted a place where I could share my story, skills, and projects. But just as
much as this, I wanted to challenge myself to craft a website without the internal libraries I had been using at my internship.
So I set out to build my own website.
